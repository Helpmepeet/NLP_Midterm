# Student Score Prediction (NLP Project)

This project predicts student scores based on short written answers using natural language processing (NLP). It was developed for a university competition.

## Project Overview

The task is to predict how well students answered each question by analyzing their text responses. The goal is to help automate grading in an accurate and consistent way.

## Model and Tools

- Fine-tuned a BERT model using Hugging Face Transformers
- Used PyTorch for model training
- Built and tested everything on Google Colab

## Libraries

- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy

## Files

- `Score_prediction.ipynb` — the full notebook: data loading, preprocessing, training, and prediction
- `README.md` — project description

## How to Use

You can view and run the notebook in Colab:
